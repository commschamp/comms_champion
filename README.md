# IMPORTANT NOTICE
Since release v4.0 this project is deprecated. For convenience it has been split into 
two separate ones:

- [COMMS Library](https://github.com/commschamp/comms)
- [CommsChampion Tools](https://github.com/commschamp/cc_tools_qt)

Please use them instead.

This project is now a simple wrapper arount the ones listed above. It 
still can be used for backward compatibility, but it is not recommended.

----

This project is a core (and a member) of 
[CommsChampion Ecosystem](https://commschamp.github.io),
which comes to help in 
developing binary communication protocols, with main focus on
**embedded systems** with limited resources (including 
bare-metal ones) and choosing **C++(11)** programming language to do so. 

This project has two major parts: [COMMS Library](#comms-library) and 
[CommsChampion Tools](#commschampion-tools). The library's components
can be used to define protocol messages as well as its transport
framing information using mostly declarative statements of classes and types 
definitions. The tools can be used to visualise, analyse, and debug binary 
communication protocols, which were developed using [COMMS Library](#comms-library).

# COMMS Library
**IMPORTANT**: The COMMS library has been relocated to a 
separate [repository](https://github.com/commschamp/comms). Please open
it to read the description.

# CommsChampion Tools
**IMPORTANT**: The tools have been relocated to a 
separate [repository](https://github.com/commschamp/cc_tools_qt). Please open
it to read the description.
