This project is a core (and a member) of 
[CommsChampion Ecosystem](https://commschamp.github.io),
which comes to help in 
developing binary communication protocols, with main focus on
**embedded systems** with limited resources (including 
bare-metal ones) and choosing **C++(11)** programming language to do so. 

This project has two major parts: [COMMS Library](#comms-library) and 
[CommsChampion Tools](#commschampion-tools). The library's components
can be used to define protocol messages as well as its transport
framing information using mostly declarative statements of classes and types 
definitions. The tools can be used to visualise, analyse, and debug binary 
communication protocols, which were developed using [COMMS Library](#comms-library).

# COMMS Library
**COMMS** is the **C++(11)** headers only, platform independent library, 
which makes the implementation of a communication
protocol to be an easy and relatively quick process. It provides all the necessary
types and classes to make the definition of the custom messages, as well as
wrapping transport data fields, to be simple declarative statements of type and
class definitions. These statements will specify **WHAT** needs to be implemented. 
The **COMMS** library internals handle the **HOW** part.

The internals of the **COMMS** library is mostly template classes which use 
multiple meta-programming techniques. As the result, only the functionality,
required by the protocol being developed, gets compiled in, providing the best code size and
speed performance possible. The down side is that compilation process may
take a significant amount of time and consume a lot of memory.

The **COMMS** library allows having **single implementation** of the binary 
protocol messages, which can be re-compiled and used for any possible application:
bare-metal with constrained resources, Linux based embedded systems, even 
independent GUI analysis tools.

The **COMMS** library was specifically developed to be used in **embedded** systems
including **bare-metal** ones. It doesn't use exceptions and/or RTTI. It also
minimises usage of dynamic memory allocation and provides an ability to exclude
it altogether if required, which may be needed when developing **bare-metal**
embedded systems. 

Core ideas and architecture of the **COMMS** library is described in
[Guide to Implementing Communication Protocols in C++](https://commschamp.github.io/comms_protocols_cpp/) free e-book.
However, at this stage the library internals are much more advanced and sophisticated, than
examples in the e-book, please don't treat the latter as a guide to library's internals.

Full [doxygen](www.doxygen.org) generated documentation with the full tutorial inside can be
read [online](https://commschamp.github.io/comms_doc/) and/or
downloaded as **doc_comms_vX.zip** archive from 
[release artefacts](https://github.com/commschamp/comms_champion/releases).

For quick usage examples please refer to [EXAMPLES.md](EXAMPLES.md).

# CommsChampion Tools
This project also contains a set of tool applications (in addition to the 
[COMMS Library](#comms-library)), which can be used to 
develop, monitor and debug custom binary communication protocols, that where
developed using the [COMMS Library](#comms-library). 
All the applications are plug-in based, i.e. plug-ins are used to define 
I/O socket, data filters, and the custom protocol itself. The tools
use [Qt5](http://www.qt.io/) framework for GUI interfaces as well as loading
and managing plug-ins.

The current list of available applications is below. Please refer to the
[wiki page](https://github.com/commschamp/comms_champion/wiki/How-to-Use-CommsChampion-Tools)
for tutorial on how to use them.

- **cc_view** is the main generic GUI application for visualisation and analysis of the
communication protocols.  

- **cc_dump** is a command line utility, that recognises all the received
custom binary protocol messages and dumps them all in CSV format to standard output.
It can also record the incoming message into the file, which can be opened
later for visual analysis using **cc_view** GUI application. 
The tool has an ability to receive a file with definition of outgoing messages, 
created using **cc_view** GUI application, and send them one by one 
in parallel to dumping/recording the incoming messages.

The [CommsChampion Tools](#commschampion-tools) package provides the following
plugins that can be used with any application:

- **null_socket** - NULL socket, that doesn't produce any incoming data and
discards any outgoing data.
- **echo_socket** - Echo socket, all the data being sent is immediately reported
as an incoming data.
- **serial_socket** - Low level socket that sends and receives data over serial
(RS-232) I/O link.
- **tcp_client_socket** - Client TCP/IP socket, that connects to remote 
server, sends and receives data over TCP/IP network link.
- **tcp_server_socket** - Server TCP/IP socket, waits for and accepts all
connections from TCP/IP clients, sends and receives data to/from them.
- **tcp_proxy_socket** - Proxy server TCP/IP socket, combines Server and Client
side of TCP/IP connection, can be used to monitor traffic of the messages between
remote a client and a server.
- **udp_socket** - Generic (client/server) UDP/IP socket.
- **raw_data_protocol** - Protocol definition that defines only a single message
type with one field of unlimited length data. It can be used to review the
raw data being received from I/O socket.

### Developing Custom Socket/Filter/Protocol Plugin
The full tutorial as well as API documentation can be downloaded as
**doc_commschampion_vX.zip** archive from
from [release artefacts](https://github.com/commschamp/comms_champion/releases).

# Demos and Examples
Over the years the 
[COMMS Library](#comms-library) grew with features and accumulated
multiple nuances to be remembered when defining a new protocol. In order to
simplify protocol definition work, a separate toolset, called 
[commsdsl](https://github.com/commschamp/commsdsl) (hosted as separate repository), 
has been developed. It allows much easier and simpler definition of the protocol, 
using schema files written in XML based domain specific language, called 
[CommsDSL](https://github.com/commschamp/CommsDSL-Specification). The toolset
will generate a C++11 code that defines the protocol using appropriate
[COMMS Library](#comms-library) classes and functions, as well as generate extra code
required to implement a protocol definition plugin for 
[CommsChampion Tools](#commschampion-tools). Many binary protocols 
may have nuances that are difficult to express in existing schema language. 
In order to still allow usage of the schema files for the protocol definition, the
toolset allows injection of extra custom code to modify or extend the generated
one. The generated code itself is also highly compile time customisable. It
allows selection of custom data structures for data storage as well as polymorphic
interfaces relevant to the application being developed.

As the result, manual implementation of binary communication protocols **from 
scratch** using 
[COMMS Library](#comms-library) is not recommended and should be avoided. Please use
**commsdsl2comms** code generator from 
[commsdsl](https://github.com/commschamp/commsdsl) project, which also
lists multiple available protocols (with usage examples) that can be used
as reference.

Please check the [doc](doc) folder for the available additional documentation.

# How to Run CommsChampion Tools applications
On Windows platforms try to run the *.exe binary (**cc_view.exe**
or **cc_dump.exe**), which resides in 
**${CMAKE_ISNTALL_PREFIX}/bin** directory. If the execution fails due to missing **Qt5** dlls,
either set your **%PATH%** variable accordingly or try to execute generated **.bat**
files (**cc_view.bat** or **cc_dump.bat**) residing in the same directory. Another
option is to build **deploy_qt** target to deploy Qt5 libraries into installation directory, which will allow execution of any **.exe** file without any extra manipulations.

On Linux platforms use the appropriate shell script 
(**cc_view.sh** or **cc_dump.sh**), which also resides in
**${CMAKE_ISNTALL_PREFIX}/bin** directory.
 
Please note that available plugins must reside in the **${CMAKE_ISNTALL_PREFIX}/lib/CommsChampion/plugin** directory.

The tools support multiple command line options, please use "-h" or "--help" for
the full list.

>$> ./install/bin/cc_view.sh -h

>$> ./install/bin/cc_dump.sh -h

# Branching Model
